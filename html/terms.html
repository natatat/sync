In addition, personal information provided by the Prospective Member may be used by the Company or its service provider, on Company's behalf, to contact Members and/or Prospective Members in regard to their participation in the Program and to receive e-mail communications from Company about its Products and Services.

        <h3>5.2 – HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS:</h3>
        <p>a. Program Participation</p>
        <p>Generally: To participate, a Member shall provide the Prospective Member with the Member’s Credit Code. The Prospective Member must click on the Credit Code and complete the sign up in the same session. If the Prospective Member does not complete the sign up in the same session, the Member will be not be credited for that referral and will not be eligible for the Credit, even if the Prospective Member subsequently signs up for a Membership. For purposes of clarification, completion of sign-up in the same session means clicking the Credit Code provided by Member and completing SYNC service sign-up within a reasonable period of time and without the Prospective Member closing their Internet browser or pressing the back button.</p>
        <p>b. Eligible Member</p>
        <p>To be eligible for Program and to receive Credits, a Member must:</p>
        <p>Be a legal resident of the United States;</p>
        <p>Be at least 18 years old;</p>
        <p>Have provided the Prospective Customer with their correct unique Credit Code; and</p>
        <p>Have a Membership account in good standing with DSC.</p>
        <p>Employees of the Company, its service providers or any of its or their subsidiaries, affiliates or promotional agencies, including immediate family and household members, are not eligible.</p>
        <p>c. Personalized Referral Links</p>
        <p>Company offers Members the opportunity to create their own personalized referral name ("Personalized Referral Link"). These Personalized Referral Links may be of any length and include any combination of words and/or numbers of the Member's choosing. Personalized Referral Links shall be on a first come, first served basis. You can check Your Personalized Referral Link by going to www.stuffyouneedcheap.com/invite. Company is in no way responsible for confirming or ensuring that the Personalized Referral Link is accurate or correctly formatted or spelled. Under no circumstances may a Member transfer or sell a Personalized Referral Link to another Member. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to revoke, ban, or amend any Personalized Referral Link at any time and for any reason. Any or all Credits earned through a revoked, banned, or amended Personalized Referral Link may be removed from Member’s account by Company. For purposes of clarification, but in no way limiting the Company's rights to revoke, ban, or amend any Personalized Referral Link, the following Personalized Referral Links are explicitly banned and may be grounds for suspension of Membership and removal of any Credits earned:</p>
        <p>Personalized Referral Links that imply a discount or savings on Membership (e.g. 5DollarsOff, 5buxOff, FreeBlades, 5Off, etc.);</p>
        <p>Personalized Referral Links that Company deems to be obscene, racist, sexist, or offensive in its sole discretion;</p>
        <p>Personalized Referral Links that use a trademark, copyright, or the name of another individual.</p>
        <p>Personalized Referral Links that are promoted, advertised, or publicized on any Company owned or operated websites, third party websites, social networks, and any other similarly situated Internet site, property, location, or asset where Company is an Administrator or Trustee. By way of example, this includes but is not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Company Blog, or any other similarly situated websites.</p>
        <p>d. Making a Referral</p>
        <p>Members can refer Prospective Members by giving their Credit Code to the Prospective Member. Once a Prospective Member uses a Member’s Credit Code and successfully completes the signup process for the DSC services, the Member may receive a communication from the Company confirming that the Prospective Member has signed up. The confirmation communication to the Member shall include some of the Prospective Member’s personal information provided to Company such as name and email address. A Member’s failure to receive such a confirmation communication means that the Prospective Member failed to complete the signup process (during the same session, or at all) and no Credit will have been earned. The Member and/or the Prospective Member may email Company any comments or questions in regard to a failed referral, but whether to award Member the Credit shall be at Company’s sole discretion. Prospective Members must satisfy the requirements of these Terms and Conditions and consent to receiving communications from DSC. Members may not refer themselves.</p>
        <p>For purposes of emphasis and clarification, by using a Credit Code, a Prospective Member acknowledges and affirms his/her understanding that some of his/her personal information, including but not limited to his/her name and email address, may be sent to the Member who provided the Credit Code as confirmation of the Prospective Member’s successful referral and sign-up with DSC. Accordingly, DSC strongly advises that Prospective Members only use a Credit Code they receive from someone whom they personally know and trust. For their own security, Prospective Members should not use a Credit Code if they receive it from an unknown, untrusted, or public source, such as an Internet forum.</p>
        <p>e. Qualified Referrals</p>
        <p>A Qualified Referral means that all the following conditions are met:</p>
        <p>The Prospective Member completed the registration process for a Membership using the Member’s Credit Code. If a Prospective Member registers for a Membership using any other link or method, the registration will not count as a Qualified Referral and the Member will not be rewarded a Credit;</p>
        <p>The Prospective Member was not previously registered with the Service under any other email address or alias; and</p>
        <p>The Prospective Member is a) at least 18 years old; b) meets the eligibility requirements to become a Member of DSC’s services; and c) has consented to receiving communications from DSC.</p>
        <p>f. Earning Credits</p>
        <p>Member shall receive five (5) Credits for each verified Qualified Referral generated through the Member’s Credit Code. The actual Credit will be determined by DSC in its sole discretion as specified on its Credits Page. If the Credit consists of credit, such credit may only be applied in the amount specified by DSC towards the Member’s purchase of future services from DSC. A Member may attain an unlimited number of Qualified Referrals, but any Qualified Referral shall be subject to review at any time by DSC and it is in the sole discretion of DSC as to the legitimacy and validity of such Qualified Referral.</p>
        <p>g. Verified Qualified Referrals</p>
        <p>All Credits are subject to verification. The Company may delay a Credit for the purposes of investigation. Company may also refuse to verify and process any transaction Company deems, in its sole discretion, to be fraudulent, suspicious, or in violation of these Terms and Conditions, or Company believes will impose potential liability on Company beyond what is reasonable for this Referral Program, its subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents. Company may cancel, amend or revoke the Credit at any time due to business considerations of circumstances beyond Company’s control. Company is not responsible for errors, omissions, malfunctions, interruptions, deletions, delays or failures of operations. All of the Company's decisions are final and binding, including decisions as to whether a Qualified Referral or Credit is verified.</p>
        <p>h. Value of Credit</p>
        <p>Credits have absolutely no monetary value and may not, under any circumstances, be redeemed for cash or any cash equivalent including but not limited to gift cards, certificates, or refunds. Company may cancel, amend or revoke the Credit at any time for any reason.</p>
        <p>i. Transfer of Credits</p>
        <p>Credits are personal to the Member and are not transferable and may not be auctioned, traded, bartered or sold, whether by operation of law or otherwise. Upon termination of the Program or any portion thereof for any reason, or upon cancellation of a Member’s account for any reason, any unredeemed Credits (including without limitation any unapplied credits) accumulated by the Member are forfeited.</p>

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE BY LAW, THE COMPANY'S, INCLUDING ANY VENDORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE), WILL NOT EXCEED $100 (ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS).</p>
        <p>c. IN NO EVENT DOES THE COMPANY EXCLUDE OR LIMIT ITS LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH CAUSED BY ITS NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD, OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF WHICH IS NOT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

        <p>If a Member provides a Credit Code to a Prospective Member by email, the email must be created and distributed in a personal manner that is appropriate and customary for communications with friends, colleagues and family members. By using a Member’s Credit Code, the Prospective Member represents that he/she has given consent to Company to send Member his/her personal information such as full name and email address.</p>
        <p>Bulk email distribution, distribution to strangers, or any other promotion of a Credit Code in a manner that would constitute or appear to constitute unsolicited commercial email or "spam" in the Company's sole discretion is expressly prohibited and may be grounds for immediate termination of the Member’s account and deactivation of the Credit Code. We have a zero-tolerance spam policy.</p>

        <p>c. Fraudulent and Suspicious Behavior</p>
        <p>The Company may prohibit a Member from participating in the Program or receiving a Credit, in their sole discretion, if they determine such Member, either directly or indirectly is attempting to undermine the fairness, integrity or legitimate operation of the Program in any way by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices that would in any way annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other users or representatives of the Company.</p>
        <p>Use of any automated system, script, or macro to participate in the Program or generate Qualified Referrals is strictly prohibited and will result in the responsible Member’s disqualification from the Program.</p>
        <p>Members may not enter with multiple or fake email addresses or accounts, use fictitious identities or use any system, bot or other device or artifice to participate in the Program or receive a Credit.</p>
        <p>The Company reserves the right to disqualify any Member and/or cancel any Credit(s) if they determine a Member has tampered with the operation of the Program or violated these Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>The Company reserves the right to suspend, disqualify or terminate any Member’s or Prospective Member’s participation in the Program and forfeit any Credits or credits earned if the Member or Prospective Member is found to have engaged in any prohibited conduct or otherwise violated the provisions of this Section 5. If Members have engaged in prohibited conduct, spam or fraudulent or suspicious behavior that undermines or affects the integrity or credibility of the Program, and the Company is unable to find a solution to restore the integrity and credibility of the Program, then the Company may in its sole discretion cancel, change or suspect the Program.</p>
        <p>CAUTION: ANY DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO DAMAGE OR UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAWS AND WILL RESULT IN DISQUALIFICATION FROM FURTHER PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM. THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SEEK REMEDIES AND DAMAGES (INCLUDING ATTORNEY FEES) TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW, INCLUDING CRIMINAL PROSECUTION, IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH ATTEMPT.</p>

        <h3>11 – DISPUTE AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER; CHOICE OF LAW</h3>
        <h3>11.1 – Dispute and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</h3>
        <p>Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.</p>
        <p>Summary:</p>
        <p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer’s satisfaction by writing to our customer service department getinsync@stuffyouneedcheap.com or StuffYouNeedCheap.com LLC, Attn: Customer Service, 2516 Via Tejon #114, Palos Verdes Estates, CA 90274. In the unlikely event that our customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if we have not been able to resolve a dispute we have with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT (OTHER THAN THOSE RELATED TO StuffYouNeedCheap.com LLC’S ENFORCEMENT AND PROTECTION OF ITS NAME AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS) through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. This includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>
        <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.</p>
        <p>We each also agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply (despite the choice of law provision in Section 11.2 below). ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. Neither you nor StuffYouNeedCheap.com LLC has the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim.</p>
        <p>All disputes relating in any way, directly or indirectly, to StuffYouNeedCheap.com LLC for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, personal injury, intentional torts or other tort will be arbitrated according to the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in Los Angeles, California, including any dispute about the scope of this arbitration agreement, and including all questions about the types of disputes that are subject to this arbitration agreement, all of which you agree will be decided by the arbitrators, whose decision will be final and binding on you. Any issue concerning the extent to which a dispute is subject to arbitration, or concerning the applicability, interpretation or enforceability of this Agreement, including any contention that all or part of this agreement is invalid or unenforceable, shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and resolved by the arbitrators. You acknowledge and agree that, in any arbitration proceeding, no depositions will be taken, and all other forms of discovery of facts will be limited to those things that the arbitrators determine, in their sole discretion, to be necessary. Further, in any arbitration proceeding, (i)there shall be no award of punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential or other special damages, (ii)all damages claims and awards will be governed by the provisions of the California Civil Code, and (iii)the parties will conduct the arbitration confidentially and expeditiously and will pay their own costs and expenses of arbitration, including their own attorneys’ fees. If you are unable to afford the AAA fee, you agree to notify all persons against whom you have an arbitrable claim and give such persons the opportunity individually and as a group to pay such fee. The proceeding and the decision shall be kept confidential by the parties.</p>
        <h3>11.2 – Choice of Law</h3>
        <p>This Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules. Foreign laws do not apply. Arbitration or court proceedings must be in Los Angeles County, California. If any provision of the Agreement is invalid under the law of a particular jurisdiction, that provision will not apply in that jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded from this Agreement.</p>
        <h3>12 – ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS; GENERAL TERMS</h3>
        <h3>12.1 – Electronic Communications</h3>

        <h3>12.2 – General Terms</h3>
        <p>StuffYouNeedCheap.com LLC may issue a warning, temporarily suspend, indefinitely suspend or terminate any Customer’s right to use or access all or any part of the Site including any account thereon, without notice, for any reason in StuffYouNeedCheap.com LLC’s sole discretion, including without limitation breach of this Agreement and/or violation of the Terms of Service, StuffYouNeedCheap.com LLC’s belief that such access would violate any applicable law, rule or regulation or would be harmful to the interests of, or potentially cause financial loss or legal liability to StuffYouNeedCheap.com LLC or another user of the Site.

StuffYouNeedCheap.com LLC will not be responsible for failures to fulfill any of its obligations due to causes beyond its control.

The parties shall at all times and for all purposes be deemed to be independent contractors and neither party nor its agents may bind the other party. The parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and all related documents that may be drawn up are only valid in the English language. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties, except that each indemnified StuffYouNeedCheap.com LLC Party shall be a third party beneficiary hereunder. StuffYouNeedCheap.com LLC may assign or transfer its rights, or delegate any performance, under this Agreement to a third party in its sole discretion.

All terms which by their nature are intended to survive any termination of this Agreement, or any termination of your use of the Site, Content, Products or Memberships shall survive such termination.</p>
