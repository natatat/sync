        <p>Personalized Referral Links that imply a discount or savings on Membership (e.g. 5DollarsOff, 5buxOff, FreeBlades, 5Off, etc.);</p>
        <p>Personalized Referral Links that Company deems to be obscene, racist, sexist, or offensive in its sole discretion;</p>
        <p>Personalized Referral Links that use a trademark, copyright, or the name of another individual.</p>
        <p>Personalized Referral Links that are promoted, advertised, or publicized on any Company owned or operated websites, third party websites, social networks, and any other similarly situated Internet site, property, location, or asset where Company is an Administrator or Trustee. By way of example, this includes but is not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Company Blog, or any other similarly situated websites.</p>
        <p>d. Making a Referral</p>
        <p>Members can refer Prospective Members by giving their Personal Link to the Prospective Member. Once a Prospective Member uses a Member’s Personal Link and successfully completes the signup process for the DSC services, the Member may receive a communication from the Company confirming that the Prospective Member has signed up. The confirmation communication to the Member shall include some of the Prospective Member’s personal information provided to Company such as name and email address. A Member’s failure to receive such a confirmation communication means that the Prospective Member failed to complete the signup process (during the same session, or at all) and no Credit will have been earned. The Member and/or the Prospective Member may email Company any comments or questions in regard to a failed referral, but whether to award Member the Credit shall be at Company’s sole discretion. Prospective Members must satisfy the requirements of these Terms and Conditions and consent to receiving communications from DSC. Members may not refer themselves.</p>
        <p>For purposes of emphasis and clarification, by using a Personal Link, a Prospective Member acknowledges and affirms his/her understanding that some of his/her personal information, including but not limited to his/her name and email address, may be sent to the Member who provided the Personal Link as confirmation of the Prospective Member’s successful referral and sign-up with DSC. Accordingly, DSC strongly advises that Prospective Members only use a Personal Link they receive from someone whom they personally know and trust. For their own security, Prospective Members should not use a Personal Link if they receive it from an unknown, untrusted, or public source, such as an Internet forum.</p>
        <p>e. Qualified Referrals</p>
        <p>A Qualified Referral means that all the following conditions are met:</p>
        <p>The Prospective Member completed the registration process for a Membership using the Member’s Personal Link. If a Prospective Member registers for a Membership using any other link or method, the registration will not count as a Qualified Referral and the Member will not be rewarded a Credit;</p>
        <p>The Prospective Member was not previously registered with the Service under any other email address or alias; and</p>
        <p>The Prospective Member is a) at least 18 years old; b) meets the eligibility requirements to become a Member of DSC’s services; and c) has consented to receiving communications from DSC.</p>
        <p>f. Earning Credits</p>
        <p>Member shall receive five (5) Credits for each verified Qualified Referral generated through the Member’s Personal Link. The actual Credit will be determined by DSC in its sole discretion as specified on its Credits Page. If the Credit consists of credit, such credit may only be applied in the amount specified by DSC towards the Member’s purchase of future services from DSC. A Member may attain an unlimited number of Qualified Referrals, but any Qualified Referral shall be subject to review at any time by DSC and it is in the sole discretion of DSC as to the legitimacy and validity of such Qualified Referral.</p>
        <p>g. Verified Qualified Referrals</p>
        <p>All Credits are subject to verification. The Company may delay a Credit for the purposes of investigation. Company may also refuse to verify and process any transaction Company deems, in its sole discretion, to be fraudulent, suspicious, or in violation of these Terms and Conditions, or Company believes will impose potential liability on Company beyond what is reasonable for this Referral Program, its subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents. Company may cancel, amend or revoke the Credit at any time due to business considerations of circumstances beyond Company’s control. Company is not responsible for errors, omissions, malfunctions, interruptions, deletions, delays or failures of operations. All of the Company's decisions are final and binding, including decisions as to whether a Qualified Referral or Credit is verified.</p>
        <p>h. Value of Credit</p>
        <p>Credits have absolutely no monetary value and may not, under any circumstances, be redeemed for cash or any cash equivalent including but not limited to gift cards, certificates, or refunds. Company may cancel, amend or revoke the Credit at any time for any reason.</p>
        <p>i. Transfer of Credits</p>
        <p>Credits are personal to the Member and are not transferable and may not be auctioned, traded, bartered or sold, whether by operation of law or otherwise. Upon termination of the Program or any portion thereof for any reason, or upon cancellation of a Member’s account for any reason, any unredeemed Credits (including without limitation any unapplied credits) accumulated by the Member are forfeited.</p>

        <h3>11 – DISPUTE AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER; CHOICE OF LAW</h3>
        <h3>11.1 – Dispute and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</h3>
        <p>Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.</p>
        <p>Summary:</p>
        <p[>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer’s satisfaction by writing to our customer service department info@stuffyouneedcheap.com or Stuff You Need Cheap, Attn: Customer Service, Box 5481, Santa Monica, California 90409. In the unlikely event that our customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if we have not been able to resolve a dispute we have with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT (OTHER THAN THOSE RELATED TO Stuff You Need Cheap’S ENFORCEMENT AND PROTECTION OF ITS NAME AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS) through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. This includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p[>
        <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.</p>
        <p>We each also agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply (despite the choice of law provision in Section 11.2 below). ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. Neither you nor Stuff You Need Cheap has the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim.</p>
        <p>All disputes relating in any way, directly or indirectly, to Stuff You Need Cheap for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, personal injury, intentional torts or other tort will be arbitrated according to the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in Los Angeles, California, including any dispute about the scope of this arbitration agreement, and including all questions about the types of disputes that are subject to this arbitration agreement, all of which you agree will be decided by the arbitrators, whose decision will be final and binding on you. Any issue concerning the extent to which a dispute is subject to arbitration, or concerning the applicability, interpretation or enforceability of this Agreement, including any contention that all or part of this agreement is invalid or unenforceable, shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and resolved by the arbitrators. You acknowledge and agree that, in any arbitration proceeding, no depositions will be taken, and all other forms of discovery of facts will be limited to those things that the arbitrators determine, in their sole discretion, to be necessary. Further, in any arbitration proceeding, (i)there shall be no award of punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential or other special damages, (ii)all damages claims and awards will be governed by the provisions of the California Civil Code, and (iii)the parties will conduct the arbitration confidentially and expeditiously and will pay their own costs and expenses of arbitration, including their own attorneys’ fees. If you are unable to afford the AAA fee, you agree to notify all persons against whom you have an arbitrable claim and give such persons the opportunity individually and as a group to pay such fee. The proceeding and the decision shall be kept confidential by the parties.</p>
        <h3>11.2 – Choice of Law</h3>
        <h3>This Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules. Foreign laws do not apply. Arbitration or court proceedings must be in Los Angeles County, California. If any provision of the Agreement is invalid under the law of a particular jurisdiction, that provision will not apply in that jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded from this Agreement.</h3>
